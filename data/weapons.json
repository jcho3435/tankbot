However during the bounce, which is rather high as well, the digger can be influenced by wind, x2 Buff, bumpers, portals and even targets. Portals rarely change anything since the weapon goes right back through the portal again. However if the high point of the bounce is within the portal, then the digger will not return to the original spot and instead starts to dig under the exit portal. It is also possible that you don't do full damage.

If there are no alive tanks in the way, the shell simply glides out of the map. Because of its infinite lifespan on the ground, it will pass through any bumpers in the way as well. Firing at 90 degrees doesn't lead you anywhere, as well as firing too steeply into the ground.
